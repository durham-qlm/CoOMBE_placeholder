# CoOMBE
**Co**mbined **O**ptical and **M**axwell-**B**loch **E**quations

CoOMBE is a collection of Fortran program with two general aims:

1. integrating the optical Bloch equations for atoms interacting with one or several laser fields (i.e., integrating the equations governing the time evolution of the density matrix representing the quantum state of these atoms),
2. integrating the Maxwell-Bloch equations for one or two laser fields (co)- propagating in an atomic vapour (i.e., integrating the equations describing how these fields evolve when propagating in such a medium).

This repository is currently empty. It will populated with the published programs and related files and documentation in due time.
